## Hello, World! 👋

#### 02 Jun 2021, Berlin

<br />

Hi there! I am Sreeram. I am a Web Developer. I work for Bumble in London. I consider myself an artist in the world of web painting it with the colors of Javascript with a touch of creativity. Ever since 2011, my job has taken me around the world to work for some great companies amongst some of the best engineering minds in the world. I will be sharing anecdotes of the experiences I have had and the impact it has had in my life.

Outside of work, I am also a Student Pilot enroute getting my pilots license. Its the high octane activity I engage in which takes my mind away from code and computers sometimes. 
I also have a keen interest in teaching. I used to be a bad student in my schooling days and I realized late that I had the potential to do way better. Thats probably why I have developed my own idea of how teching is to be done. Today, I am a part-time teacher teaching people programming online. 
I travel regularly and have so far been to about 15 countries. I try to spend summers in Europe visiting my friends there and winters in India where my parents are. 
I cook, mostly Indian, but I am expanding my repertoire to other cuisines. I recently learnt how to make Biriyani.
I speak a few languages - Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, and English. I have learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too. 
I play a lot of cricket during the summer months. A cringeworthy thing is from 2015 to 2017 I practiced every day to be able to play in 2019 world cup. Didnt succeed.
I tend to have strong opinions on socio-political issues around the world, sometimes controversial. 

Lastly, I'm generally a friendly, easy going, down-to-earth, respectable, reliable, someone one can talk about anything to - life, politics, movies or whatever (except songs). I am meticulous and abmitious and I move steadfast towards my goals.
